\description{
It calculates 1) the prevalence from daily incidence in the community and average disease duration,
2) the probability of transmission per day spent in contact based on R0 and average disease duration,
3) the time ratios of the epidemiological state based on average states duration,
4) the proportion of time outside of work, and
5) the proportion of probabilities of developing mild and severe symptoms for patients.

Then the functions formats all global parameters required for the transitions as a named list readable by SimInf package.
